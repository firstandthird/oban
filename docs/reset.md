##Reset

Oban provides three mixins to handle resets for your site.  The first is [Eric Meyer's reset](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/05/01/reset-reloaded/) and second is [normalize]() and the third is an html5 reset.

####Less Usage

```css
//eric meyer's
.oban-reset();

//normalize
.oban-normalize();

html5
.oban-reset-html5();
```
