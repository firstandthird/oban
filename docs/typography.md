##Typography

The typography mixin gives you one simple mixin to set all of your body copy and headlines across the site.  You just pass in a body size and a line height and Oban will generate the sizes and line heights for h1-h6 as well as p tags.

####Less Usage
```css
.oban-typography(@family: ~"'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif", @bodySize: 14px, @lineHeight: 20px);
```
